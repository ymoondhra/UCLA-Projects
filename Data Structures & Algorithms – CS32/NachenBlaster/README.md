# NachenBlaster
We were given the setup and environment for an empty game. The assignment was to build a C++ program very similar to the video game Galaga (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvjapcHsqXY), where the user shoots cabbages at alien ships. Each level becomes increasingly difficult, as the aliens move faster, gain health, and increase in speed. The user's spaceship, called the NachenBlaster, can pick up powerups such as torpedos or extra lives. <br />
To create this application, I used inheritance (Actor.h), polymorphism (Actor.cpp), and encapsulation (StudentWorld.cpp).
