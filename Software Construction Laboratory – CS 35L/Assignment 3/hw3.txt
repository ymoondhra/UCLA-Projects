QUESTION 1: The original ls function took 0.045s seconds to complete
(time ./bin/ls), whereas the patched ls function took 0.029s to complete
(time ./coreutils/src/ls). Therefore, the patched ls function is faster.

QUESTION 2: The original code only sets ignore_mode to IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT
if ignore_mode is IGNORE_DEFAULT. However, with the patch, no matter what
we will always set ignore_mode to IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT. This can pose
problems if we want to ignore things in a different way, other than
IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT. For example, if we want to set ignore_mode to some
special type of ignore (i.e. ignore_mode = IGNORE_SPECIAL), then no matter
what ignore_mode will always be set to IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT.

QUESTION 3: When the input file is empty, the root error is that the imported
function from random (random.choice) expects that its input has at least 1
line. This raises and IndexError: list index out of range. This returns to
the chooseline(self) function, which returns an error to line 64 when
generator.chooseline() is served as an input to sys.stdout.write(). Finally,
the main function receives the error in line 70.

QUESTION 4: When I run “python3 randline.py /dev/null, the terminal returns
a syntax error because in Python3, the proper syntax is “except IOError as
err”. You cannot do except IOError as (errno, strerror).
