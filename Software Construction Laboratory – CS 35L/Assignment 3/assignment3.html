<h1>Assignment 3. Modifying and rewriting software</h1>

<h2>Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package</h2>

<p>Keep a log in the file <code>lab3.txt</code> of what you do in the
lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should not
merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened.</p>

<p>You're helping to build an application containing a shell script
that invokes the <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/ls.html'><code>ls</code></a>
command to get file status.
Your application is running atop the Maroon Chapeau Enterprise Linux 8 distribution, which uses the <code>ls</code> implementation supplied by <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/'>Coreutils</a> 8.29.
You've been
running into the problem that some users create a shell
script <code>la</code> with the following contents:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
exec ls -a "$@"
</code></pre>

<p>For these users the command <code>la -A</code> is therefore
equivalent to <code>ls -a -A</code>. Unfortunately, with
Coreutils <code>ls</code>, the <code>-a</code> option always overrides
the <code>-A</code> option regardless of which option is given first,
so the <code>-A</code> option has no effect in <code>la</code>.  For
example, if the current directory has two files
named <code>.foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, the command <code>la
-A</code> outputs four lines, one each
for <code>.</code>, <code>..</code>, <code>.foo</code>,
and <code>bar</code>. These users want <code>la -A</code> to output
just two lines instead, one for <code>.foo</code> and one
for <code>bar</code>. That is, for <code>ls</code> they want a
later <code>-A</code> option to override any earlier <code>-a</code>
option, and vice versa.</p>

<p>You've been asked to look into the problem and fix it. Start by
verifying that the problem still occurs in <code>/usr/bin/ls</code> on
the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers. Also, check the Coreutils version
that <code>/usr/bin/ls</code> corresponds to.</p>

<p>You discover that the problem is a known bug with Coreutils,
<a href='https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=30963'>Bug#30963</a>.
The bug report has a patch intended for publication in a later
Coreutils release; see its Message #10.
You don't want to wait for the later release to be installed on your system,
so you decide to build a copy of Coreutils 8.29 with just this patch
added, as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>Grab
the <a href='ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz'>Coreutils
8.29 source code compressed tarball</a> and verify
its <a href='ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig'>signature</a>
with the <a href='https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg'>GNU
keyring</a> by running the shell command <samp>gpg --verify --keyring
./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig</samp> in your directory.
Note any problems with this verification, and briefly explain why they happen.
</li>

<li>Compile and install your copy of
Coreutils into a temporary directory of your own. Note
any problems you run into.</li>

<li>Reproduce the bug on your machine with the unmodified version of
coreutils. The test case that comes with the patch should give you
ideas for how to reproduce the bug.</li>

<li>Apply the patch of Bug#30963 Message #10.
Note any problems that occur
(they should not prevent the modified coreutils from working).</li>

<li>Type the command <code>make</code> at the top level of your source
tree, so that you build the fixed version, without installing it
into your temporary directory. For each
command that gets executed, explain why it needed to be executed (or
say that it wasn't neeeded).</li>

<li>Make sure your change fixes the bug, by testing that the
modified <code>ls</code> works on the same tests where the
unmodified <code>ls</code> didn't work.</li>
</ol>

<p>Q1. Does the patch improve the performance of <code>ls</code>
or make it worse? Briefly explain.</p>

<p>Q2. If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils
instead of the default one, what else should you watch out for? Might
this new version of Coreutils introduce other problems with your
application?</p>

<h2>Homework: Rewriting a script</h2>

<p>Consider the Python script
<a href='randline.py'><code>randline.py</code></a>.</p>

<p>Q3. What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like
<code>/dev/null</code>, and why?</p>

<p>Q4. What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather
than Python 2, and why? (You can run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts by
using the command <code>python3</code> instead
of <code>python</code>.)</p>

<p>Write a new script <code>shuf.py</code> in the style
of <code>randline.py</code>; your script should implement the GNU
<code><a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/shuf-invocation.html'>shuf</a></code>
command that is part of GNU Coreutils.
You should already have a copy of the <code>shuf</code>
source code and documentation; look at the files you created in the
laboratory. However, GNU <code>shuf</code> is written in C, whereas
you want a Python implementation so that you can more easily add
new features to it.</p>

<p>Your program should support the following <code>shuf</code>
options, with the same behavior as GNU <code>shuf</code>:
<code>--input-range</code> (<code>-i</code>),
<code>--head-count</code> (<code>-n</code>),
<code>--repeat</code> (<code>-r</code>),
and <code>--help</code>.
As with GNU <code>shuf</code>, if <code>--repeat</code> (<code>-r</code>)
is used without <code>--head-count</code> (<code>-n</code>),
your program should run forever.
Your program should also support
zero non-option arguments or
a single non-option argument "<code>-</code>"
(either of which means read from standard input),
or a single non-option argument other than "<code>-</code>"
(which specifies the input file name).
Your program need not support the other options of GNU <code>shuf</code>.
As with GNU <code>shuf</code>, your program
should report an error if given invalid arguments.</p>

<p>Your <code>shuf.py</code> program should not import any
modules other than <code>argparse</code>,
<code>string</code> and the modules that <code>randline.py</code>
already imports.
Don't forget to change its usage message to
accurately describe the modified behavior.</p>

<p>Port your <code>shuf.py</code> implementation to Python 3.  If you
  have trouble with <code>optparse</code> under Python 3, you can use
  the <code>argparse</code> module instead.  Make sure that
  your <code>shuf.py</code> still works with Python 2. Don't rewrite
  it from scratch; make as few changes as is reasonable.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit the following files.</p>

<ul>

<li>The file <code>lab3.txt</code> as described in the lab.</li>

<li>A file <code>hw3.txt</code> containing the answer to questions
Q1 through Q4 noted above.</li>

<li>The file <code>shuf.py</code> as described
in the homework.</li>

</ul>

<p>All files should be ASCII text files, with no
carriage returns, and with no more than 80 columns per line. The shell
command:</p>

<pre><code>expand lab3.txt hw3.txt | awk '/\r/ || 80 &lt; length'
</code></pre>

<p>should output nothing.</p>
