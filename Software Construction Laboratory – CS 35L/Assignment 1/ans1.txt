1. man -k keyword
2. mv location: /usr/local/cs/bin/mv
   sh location: /usr/bin/sh
   I used "which <mv, sh> to find these locations
3. man find
   find . -executable -name "?r"
   man pr, tr
4. readlink /usr/bin/emacs outputs /etc/alternatives/emacs
5. cd /usr/bin
   gcc --version outputs 8.2.0
   They are different because they have different paths
6. u+sx: the user/owner can execute the file and the group ID is set
   o-w: users who are not members and are not the owner cannot write
7. cd /usr/local/cs
   find -mtime 28 -type d
   .
   ./src/bison
   ./src/bison/RCS
   ./src/grep
   ./src/grep/RCS
   ./src/ocaml
   ./src/ocaml/RCS
   ./share/info
   ./share/man/man1
   ./share/man/man3
   ./bin
8. cd /usr/bin
   ls -l | grep ^- | wc
   303 files are symbolic links
9. cd /usr/lib64
   ls -lt | grep ^-
   librom1394.so.0.3.0
10. man -k locale
    "locale (1p)          - get locale-specific information"
11. C-h a downcase
    downcase-dwim
    downcase-region
    downcase-word
12. C-M-r scroll to top window
    C-M-v scroll to bottom window
    I used C-h t to find these commands
13. C-g quits the current set of commands that the user has entered. For example, if the user has entered C-u 200, then C-g will not do the following command 200 times
14. Yank pastes the text that was killed last (commands: C-Space, highlight area, C-w, C-y to paste it). The C-h t tutorial taught me this.
15. cd /usr/bin emacs C-h f dired says that dired is bound to C-x d
    C-g
    C-x d prints "total used in directory 348248 available 11379416"
    ls -l prints "total 348160"
