The instance of XQuartz is basically separated in to two main
sections:

TOP:
	Top-left: A graphical depiction of the git tree,
	displaying the list of commits.

	Top-middle: A list of all the collaborators.
	Their email is also listed in alligator brackets.

	Top-right: A list of the date of each commit

BOTTOM:

	Bottom-top (the top of part of the bottom section):
	A tool to find commits using a searchbar and filters.

	Bottom-left: Shows the commit's details and change log

	Bottom-right: a selector for the files modified
	by the commit
