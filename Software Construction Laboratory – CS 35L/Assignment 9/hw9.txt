1.
This log documents the actions I took in the homework part of
Assignment 9.

2.
I cloned the git repository again using git clone. I made a new
branch called quote by using “git checkout v3.0 -b quote”, and the
terminal outputted a success message saying that it switched to a new
branch called “quote”.

3.
To apply the patch to this branch, I used “patch -p1 <
../quote-3.0-patch.txt” For some files, the terminal said that a
reversed (or previously applied) patch was detected. I typed “y”,
signifying continue, for each of these files.

4.
I learnt how to use the add-change-log-entry-other-window emacs
function

5.
I went to the change log of each of the six .c files by doing
emacs file. I accessed the change log by running “C-x 4 a” and typed
“converted the first grave accent in strings (not comments) to
apostrophes (')”. I exited using “C-x C-c y”

6.
git add .
git commit -F src/ChangeLog
These commands stage the files and then commits them.

7.
“git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt” creates a patch file

8.
For this lab, Revanth Yamani is my partner. I put my
formatted-patch.txt file on my local computer and then exchanged this
file with Revanth. To switch to the partner branch, I did “git
checkout v3.0 -b partner”. To apply Revanth’s patch, I did “git am
../rev-formatted-patch.txt”, which made the terminal output that it
was applying Revanth’s patch. I ran the following commands to test
Revanth’s code:
	  ./boostrap
	  ./configure
	  make
	  make check
This time, make check did not output errors

9.
Running the command “make distdir” succeeded, and one of the last
lines of output was “|| chmod -R a+r "diffutils-3.0.1-9a75”. To open
the changelog, I ran “emacs diffutils-3.0.1-3b1be/ChangeLog”.
The change log was successful modified, as I could see my partner’s
additions to the changelog of each file.

10.
When logging into lnxsrv02, I added the “-Y” option this time, which
enables trusted X11 forwarding. I called “echo $PATH” to ensure that
my path was correct: (/usr/local/cs/bin/: . . . ). To go to the
appropriate directory, I ran “cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs”. Running the
command “gitk” opened an instance of XQuartz. By scrolling through the
changes made (in the top right corner of the window), I found that the
commit on 2015-01-24 19:00:41 was the newest but not newer than
2015-01-25. Professor Eggert made this commit.
