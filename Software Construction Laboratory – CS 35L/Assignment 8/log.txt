Partner: Revanth Kumar Yamani

First, I plugged the BeagleBone circuit board into the library
computer (Windows system) using the provided micro-USB cable and
clicked the device icon on the computer. It said the drivers are
already installed on the START.htm page. Step 3 (Browse to web server
on board) was not green, meaning it had not been completed yet. I also
connected to CR3760-wifi.

I opened up Putty and typed the IP address “192.168.7.2”. I logged in
as the root user and installed xauth and xterm using “apt-get install
xauth” and “apt-get install xterm”. I also ran sudo apt-get update.

To connect it to the wifi, I used these connmanctl commands (taken
directly from the Piazza post):
sudo connmanctl
enable wifi
scan wifi
services
agent on
connect wifi_2cf7f1065372_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk
3760ClassNet //passphrase
Quit

Running ifconfig and looking at the wlan0: inet addr showed this:
10.97.85.157
My partner’s IP address is 10.97.85.153 To get into my
partner’s BeagleBone, I ran “ssh debain@10.97.85.153”, as he could not
gain access to his root user. His password was “temppwd”. Then, I
exited.

To create a non-root user account named rev2 for my partner, I ran:
sudo useradd -d /home/homedir -m rev2
sudo passwd rev2 //i made the password “1”

cd home/homedir
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R .ssh //changes the ownership of all files within .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh //changes the permissions of .ssh

I used the following commands to generate public/private rsa key pair:
cd ~
ssh-keygen //and saved it to the default directory without a passphrase

To copy my public key to the server for key-based authentication:
ssh-copy-id -i yash3@10.97.85.153 //password: yash To add private key
to authentication agent: ssh-add
The above command failed. It could
not open a connection to the authentication agent. To solve this
problem:
ssh-agent //outputted details about the identity keys and passphrases
eval $(ssh-agent) //executes ssh-agent as a shell command
ssh-add // worked: “Identity added: /root.ssh/id_rsa (rsa w/o comment)

To log in to my partner’s BeagleBone:
ssh yash3@10.97.85.153 //outputted “Linux beaglebone 4.9.78-ti-r94 . . . 
ssh -X yash3@10.97.85.153 //outputted the key fingerprint and added my
partner’s IP address to the list of known hosts.
xterm //successfully displayed on my terminal


PROBLEMS I HAD WITH THE BEAGLEBONE: When I plug the BeagleBone into my
personal computer, it says the drivers are not installed, even though
I tried all combinations of installing the drivers on Piazza. For my
partner, Revanth, he was able to install the drivers on his
beaglebone. However, once he plugged in my beaglebone, it says the
drivers are not installed. For his beaglebone, he was having the
problem that he doesn’t know what the beaglebone’s password is, even
though he bought it brand new. We ended up using the debian user for
his beaglebone, and borrowed a laptop from Boelter Hall for mine.

Because I had to use a separate computer to run the BeagleBone, I was
not able to copy some of the outputs of this lab into this
file. Everything is manually typed here.
